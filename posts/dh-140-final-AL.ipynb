    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The college application process can be a daunting yet exciting process. Throughout the process, applicants are researching schools to apply to and fields to major in. And once this is all finished, applicants must go through another process of deciding which school to commit to, which is not an easy decision to make. Throughout college as well, it is not uncommon for people to change majors, sometimes completely changing their career path or even transferring colleges. These changes are motivated by various reasons, some being salary, interest, or career opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I am approaching the end of my senior year and about to graduate, this topic has been on my mind more frequently. I also find this to be a topic of discussion amongst most of my conversations. These are all factors that I considered when applying to college and am now considering while on the job hunt, so researching more about this can allow me to have more insight on my post-grad options and how much weight my college career has on my future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research will explore the various factors that affect salary after graduation. Some of these factors include college attended, major(s), and field(s) studied. This research will allow new graduates to have a better understanding of their post-grad future and how their salary can be affected by their college career and field of choice.\n",
