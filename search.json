    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe begin by conducting exploratory data analysis to answer our research question. Specifically, in this process, we are interested in learning about general salary statistics and which majors and types of schools will lead to higher salaries.\nPlease note that all datasets had information on median salary, so we are only exploring median salary from the Salaries dataset. We will further analyze both in the later parts of the project.\n\n# Overall starting median salary\nsalaries['Starting Median Salary'].mean()\n\n46068.40148698885\n\n\nFrom the plot below, we can see that the median starting salary is right-skewed, with most starting median salaries being around \\$40000 - \\$45,000.\n\nplt.hist(salaries['Starting Median Salary'])\nplt.xlabel('Salary ($)')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Starting Median Salary (by Degree)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Starting Median Salary (by Degree)')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can explore the mid-career median salary to see the shift from the starting median salary.\n\n# Overall mid-career median salary\nsalaries['Mid-Career Median Salary'].mean()\n\n83932.34200743494\n\n\nTypically, the median salary shifts later in the career. From this Mid-Career Median Salary graph, we can see that the salary has shifted to be around \\$80,000, which is almost double what is shown in the Starting Median Salary graph (above). The mean has also increased by about \\$37,000.\n\nplt.hist(salaries['Mid-Career Median Salary'])\nplt.xlabel('Salary ($)')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Mid-Career Median Salary (by Degree)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Mid-Career Median Salary (by Degree)')\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we can explore the impact of a college’s region on salary. According to the graph, schools in California and Northeastern have a higher starting median salary.\n\n# Group the data by region type and calculate the median starting salary\ngrouped_region = region.groupby('Region')['Starting Median Salary'].median().reset_index()\n\n# Create a bar plot\nplt.bar(grouped_region['Region'], grouped_region['Starting Median Salary'])\nplt.xlabel('School Type')\nplt.ylabel('Starting Median Salary ($)')\nplt.title('Median Starting Salary by College Type')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nLastly, as part of our exploratory data analysis, we explore the relationship between starting and mid-career median salaries by major. There is a linear relationship between these two variables; with a higher starting median salary, the mid-career median salary also usually ends up being higher.\n\nplt.scatter(degrees['Starting Median Salary'], degrees['Mid-Career Median Salary'])\nplt.xlabel('Starting Median Salary ($)')\nplt.ylabel('Mid-Career Median Salary ($)')\nplt.title('Starting vs. Mid-Career Salaries')\n\n# Set x-axis tick values\nplt.xticks(range(40000, 120000, 20000))\n\n# Set y-axis tick values\nplt.yticks(range(50000, 160000, 20000))\n\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Analysis\nAfter conducting introductory analysis, we have a better idea of our data and now we can use this information to dive deeper into our datasets to answer our research question.\nFirst, we further explore the progression from starting to mid-career median salary. In general, we can see that mid-career salaries are much higher than starting salaries. While this doesn’t fully answer our research question of factors that affect salary, having knowledge of this general increase allows us to know that our starting salary is not fixed for the rest of our careers. In fact, most salaries doubled over time, as shown by the plot below.\n\n# create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# plot the histograms with transparency to show overlaps\nax.hist(salaries['Starting Median Salary'], bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Starting Median Salary')\nax.hist(salaries['Mid-Career Median Salary'], bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Mid-Career Median Salary')\n\n# set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('Salary ($)')\nax.set_ylabel('')\nax.set_title('Starting vs. Mid-Career Salaries')\n\n# add legend\nax.legend()\n\n# show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTo further explore the relationship between major studied and salary, we can identify the top ten earning majors according to their mid-career median salaries.\n\ntop_majors = degrees.sort_values(by='Mid-Career Median Salary', ascending=False).head(10)\nprint(top_majors['Undergraduate Major'])\n\n8       Chemical Engineering\n12      Computer Engineering\n19    Electrical Engineering\n1      Aerospace Engineering\n17                 Economics\n44                   Physics\n13          Computer Science\n30    Industrial Engineering\n38    Mechanical Engineering\n37                      Math\nName: Undergraduate Major, dtype: object\n\n\n\ntop_majors = degrees.sort_values(by='Mid-Career Median Salary', ascending=False).head(10)\nplt.bar(top_majors['Undergraduate Major'], top_majors['Mid-Career Median Salary'])\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.xlabel('Undergraduate Major')\nplt.ylabel('Mid-Career Median Salary ($)')\nplt.title('Top 10 Highest Paying Majors')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, we can see that Chemical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering have the highest mid-career median salaries, all totaling over \\$100,000.\nWhile major plays an important role in determining career salary, we can further explore to see if salary is affected by other factors, such as the type of school attended. From the graph below, we can see that students that attended engineering or ivy league schools typically earned higher median mid-career salaries after graduation.\n\n# Group the data by college type and calculate the median starting salary\ngrouped_salaries = salaries.groupby('School Type')['Mid-Career Median Salary'].median().reset_index()\n\n# Create a bar plot\nplt.bar(grouped_salaries['School Type'], grouped_salaries['Mid-Career Median Salary'])\nplt.xlabel('School Type')\nplt.ylabel('Mid-Career Median Salary ($)')\nplt.title('Median Mid-Career Salary by College Type')\n\nplt.show()"
